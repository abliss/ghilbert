== What is Ghilbert ==

Ghilbert is a website for math enthusiasts  to collaborate on mathematical proofs. It contains a large database of proofs and
many tools to help you write proofs. The proofs are rigorous. Every step can be traced back to an axiom or a definition and
every step has been verified.

Ghilbert is still in its early stages. Important theorems and tools are still missing, but it has huge potential to become a
home for much of the world's mathematical knowledge. We would love for you to contribute in writing proofs and contribute to
the website.

Here is a set of tutorials to get you started:
