== Suggestion Box: The Remove Button ==

In this tutorial, we will prove a simple theorem to demonstrate the remove button in
the suggestion box. We will prove that if a number A is less than 5, it is also less than
8: A < 5 → A < 8.

=== Getting Started ===

* Open up [/edit/peano/arithmetic.gh/emptyThm | this empty theorem].
* Click the X on the statement on the proof stack to clear the proof:

=== Transitive Property ===

We are now going to use the transitive property of inequality. That property is found in
the lttr theorem.

* Type "A (5) (8) lttr" into the editor.

The editor should now look like this:

and the suggestion box like this:

=== Evaluate & Remove ===

Select the left side of the expression by clicking on it. You will see the expression
A < 5 < 8 expand into A < 5 ∧ 5 < 8. The two statements are equivalent.

* Select "5 < 8" in the editor by clicking on it.
* Click evaluate:

Since 5 < 8 is true, several theorems will be automatically generated proving that
5 < 8. The editor is filled with a lot of new code and the statement 5 < 8
appears on the proof stack. The suggestion box now looks like this:

The suggestion box has two rows. The first row contains our initial statement.
The second contains the generated proof that 5 < 8. We can use the second expression
to simplify the first expression by removing the term 5 < 8 from it.

* Click "Remove".

This produces the desired outcome: A < 5 → A < 8.
