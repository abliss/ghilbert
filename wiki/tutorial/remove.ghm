== Suggestion Box: The Remove Button ==

In this tutorial, we will prove a simple theorem to demonstrate the remove button in
the suggestion box. We will prove that if a number #A# is less than #(5)#, it is also less than
#(8)#. Put more succinctly #(-> (< A (5)) (< A (8)))#.

=== Getting Started ===

* Open up [/edit/peano_new/arithmetic/common/calculations/naturals.gh/emptyThm | this empty theorem].
* Click the edit button.
* Click the X on the statement on the proof stack to clear the proof:

=== Transitive Property ===

We are now going to use the transitive property of inequality. That property is found in
the lttr theorem.

* Type "{{{A (5) (8) lttr}}}" into the editor.

The editor should now look like this:

and the suggestion box like this:

=== Evaluate & Remove ===

Select the left side of the expression by clicking on it. You will see the expression
#(/\ (< A (5)) (< (5) (8)))# expand into #(< A (5))# âˆ§   #(< (5) (8))#. The two statements are equivalent.

* Highlight "5 < 8" part in the suggestion box by clicking on it.
* Click evaluate:

Since #(< (5) (8))# is true, it will find a previously generated proof that #(< (5) (8))# and add it to
the editor. The statement #(< (5) (8))# now appears on the proof stack. The suggestion box now looks like this:

The suggestion box has two rows. The first row contains our initial statement.
The second contains the generated proof that #(< (5) (8))#. This is saying that
we can use the second statement to simplify the first statment. We can remove the
the term #(< (5) (8))# from the conditional statement because we already know that
it is always true.

* Click "Remove".

This produces the desired outcome: #(-> (< A (5)) (< A (8)))#.
