Ghilbert is an interchange format for verification of formal proofs. It is closely related to [https://www.metamath.org | Metamath], but has a stronger definition mechanism, a modular structure for proofs, and other changes. This site is a community repository of proofs, and also contains a web app for interactively editing proofs.
