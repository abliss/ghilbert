Ghilbert is an interchange format for verification of formal proofs. It is closely related to [http://www.metamath.org | Metamath], but has a stronger definition mechanism, a modular structure for proofs, and other changes. This site is a community repository of proofs, and also contains a web app for interactively editing proofs.

If you are new to proofs using verifiers in the metamath family, there's an introduction at [[http://www.wikiproofs.org/w/index.php?title=Help:Tutorial]] (although the details of that verifier are not quite the same as ghilbert's).

If you have any questions, please ask on the mailing list at [http://groups.google.com/group/ghilbert]
