== Construction of the Rationals ==

Rational numbers can be constructed from the [/wiki/peano/arithmetic/integers | integers] and
integer arithmetic. A rational number is constructed from an
[/wiki/peano/tuple/ordered-pair | ordered pair] of integers in a
[/wiki/peano/arithmetic/rationals/fraction | fraction]: #(= A (</> (top A) (bottom A)))#.
The first number in the ordered pair: #(top A)# is the
[/wiki/peano/arithmetic/rationals/top | top or numerator]. The second number #(bottom A)# in the
pair is the [/wiki/peano/arithmetic/rationals/bottom | bottom or denominator].

Two rational numbers #A# and #B# are equal if the ratio between them is equal #(= (</> (top A) (bottom A)) (</> (top B) (bottom B)))#,
but this equation requires division which has not been properly defined yet. This equation
is equivalent to #(= (* (top A) (bottom B)) (* (top B) (bottom A)))#. However, division by zero
adds a further complication. 
If we used the equation #(= (* (top A) (bottom B)) (* (top B) (bottom A)))# to define rational equality,
then the fraction #(</> (0) (0))# would be equal to all numbers. So we
add a further restriction that rational numbers are only equal if both denominators are not
#(0)# or both are #(0)#. The full definition of rational equality is given
[/edit/peano/rationals.gh/df-eqq | here].

There is more than one fraction that is equal to a given rational number. For example, one
half can be represented as #(</> (1) (2))#, or #(</> (2) (4))# or #(</> (5) (10))#. Each rational
number represents a class of [/edit/peano/rationals.gh/qequivalence | equivalent ordered pairs].

The difficult part of constructing the rationals is to shown that the arithmetic operations are
properly defined over these equivalence classes. Rational multiplication is defined by multiply the
numerators and denominators
#(= (* (</> a b) (</> c d)) (</> (z.* a c) (z.* b d))) /edit/peano/rationals.gh/qmulfrac#. Rational
addition is defined by the formula
#(= (+ (</> a b) (</> c d)) (</> (z.+ (z.* a d) (z.* c b)) (z.* b d))) /edit/peano/rationals.gh/qaddfrac#. We can prove all
the important properties of addition and multiplication with these definitions:

* Commutivity:   [/edit/peano/rationals.gh/qaddcom | add] [/edit/peano/rationals.gh/qmulcom | multiply]
* Associativity: [/edit/peano/rationals.gh/qaddass | add] [/edit/peano/rationals.gh/qmulass | multiply]
* Identities:    [/edit/peano/rationals.gh/qaddid | add] [/edit/peano/rationals.gh/qmulid | multiply]
* Inverses: [/edit/peano/rationals.gh/qaddcan | add] [/edit/peano/rationals.gh/qdivcan | multiply]
* [/edit/peano/rationals.gh/qdistr | Distributive Property]
