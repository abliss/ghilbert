== Subset âŠ† ==

The set #S# is a subset of #T# if all the elements in #S# are in #T#. If #S# equals #T#,
#S# is still a subset of #T# meaning #(-> (=_ S T) (C_ S T)) /edit/peano_new/set.gh/seqss#,
but #S# is not a [/wiki/peano/set/proper-subset | proper subset ] of #T#. Subset is defined
as #(<-> (C_ S T) (=_ (i^i S T) S)) /edit/peano_new/set_min.ghi/df-ss#.
