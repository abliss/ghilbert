== Proper Subset âŠ‚ ==

The set #S# is a subset of #T# if all the elements in #S# are in #T# and #S# is not equal to #T#.
Proper subset is defined as

#(<-> (C. S T) (/\ (C_ S T) (-. (=_ S T)))) /edit/peano_new/set_min.ghi/df-pss#

The difference between a [/wiki/peano/set/subset | subset] and a proper subset is that
when the sets are equal they are subset of each other, but not proper subsets.
