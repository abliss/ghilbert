== Proper Subset ⊂ ==

The set S is a subset of T if all the elements in S are in T and S is not equal to T.
Proper subset is defined as

S ⊂ T ↔ S ⊆ T ∧ S ≠ T	

The difference between a [/wiki/peano/set/subset | subset] and a proper subset is that
when the sets are equal they are subset of each other, but not proper subsets.
