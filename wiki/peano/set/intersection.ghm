== Intersection âˆ© ==

The intersection of two sets #(i^i S T)# is a set containing the elements that are in both sets.

#(=_ (i^i S T) ({|} x (/\ (e. x S) (e. x T)))) /edit/peano_new/set_min.ghi/df-in#

=== Properties ===

* Commutative: #(=_ (i^i S T) (i^i T S)) /edit/peano_new/set.gh/incom#
* Associative: #(=_ (i^i (i^i S T) U) (i^i S (i^i T U))) /edit/peano_new/set.gh/inass#
* Idempotent: #(=_ (i^i S S) S) /edit/peano_new/set.gh/inidm#
