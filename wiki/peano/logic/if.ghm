== Conditional → ==

The conditional is a basic operation in  [/wiki/peano/logic/logic | propositional logic]. The statment φ → ψ
means that if the statement φ is true, that implies that the statement ψ is also true.

=== Axioms ===

The properties of the conditional are derived directly from the [/peano/prop_min.ghi | logical axioms]. The axioms are
all expressed using conditional statements.
