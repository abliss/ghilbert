== Well-formed formulas (wffs) ==

Well-formed formula, often shortened to wffs, are [edit/peano/peano_thms.gh/df-tru | true] or
[edit/peano/peano_thms.gh/df-fal | false] statements. For example, #(< (3) (7))# is a well-formed formula and
so is #(= (6) (4)#. Ghilbert uses Greek symbols for wffs like φ, ψ, χ, τ, and θ. Relationships between well-
formed formulas are the subject of [/wiki/peano/logic/logic | Propositional logic].
