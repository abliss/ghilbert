== Tuple Index ==

The tuple index operation extracts a specific number from a [/wiki/peano/tuple/tuple | tuple].
which is an ordered sequence of numbers. For example, if A is a tuple and A = (2, 5, 7), then
A_1 = 2, A_2 = 5, and A_3 = 7. The index operation is defined [/edit/peano/peano_thms.gh/df-index | here].
If the index goes above the [/wiki/peano/tuple/length | length] of the tuple, it will still
return a number, but this is not a meaningful value and theorems should be constructed in such
a way that the index never goes above the tuple length.
