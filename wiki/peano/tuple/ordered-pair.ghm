== Ordered Pair (A, B) ==

(A, B) represents an ordered pair of numbers. We can map each ordered pair to a single number and
the ordered pair is actually defined as another number. The individual number can be extracted from
the ordered pair through the [/wiki/peano/tuple/head | head] and [/wiki/peano/tuple/tail | tail]
operations.

* Equivalence: [/edit/peano/peano_thms.gh/opth | (A,B) = (C,D) ↔ A = C ∧ B = D	]
