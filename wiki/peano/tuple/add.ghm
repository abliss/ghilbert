== Finite Sequence Additon ==

This operation adds up an ordered sequence of numbers. The numbers are taken from
a [/wiki/peano/tuple/tuple | tuple]. Each tuple has a [/wiki/peano/tuple/length | length]
and each number in the sequence can be extracted using the [/wiki/peano/tuple/index | index]
operation. It is defined [/edit/peano/peano_thms.gh/df-tuplesum | here]. The reason to
introduce this notation is that since we can use any tuple, this allows us to reason
abstractly about a sum of an arbitrary finite sequence of numbers.
