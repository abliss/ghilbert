# Predicate equals is identical to equality, but instead of importing as a parameter
# predicate_min, predicate, and equality_min those statements are listed here. Basically,
# this cuts down the parameters from four to one. This file checks that all the theorems
# listed in predicate_equals are also included in equality.
