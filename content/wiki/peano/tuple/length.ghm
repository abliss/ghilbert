== Tuple Length ==

A tuple is a finite sequence of numbers. Unlike with sets, the order is important. Tuples are
constructed using [/wiki/peano/tuple/ordered-pair | ordered pairs]. For example, the tuple
(A, B, C) is internally represented as (((A, B), C), 3) with the last number providing the
length of the tuple. But this is only internal. Tuples are displayed the normal way (A, B, C).
The tuple length is used in many different operations.
