== Tuple (A, B, C) ==

A tuple is a finite sequence of numbers. Unlike with sets, the order is important. Tuples are
constructed using [/wiki/peano/tuple/ordered-pair | ordered pairs]. For example, the tuple
(A, B, C) is internally represented as (((A, B), C), 3) with the last number providing the
[/wiki/peano/tuple/length | length] of the tuple. But this is only internal. Tuples are
displayed the normal way (A, B, C).
