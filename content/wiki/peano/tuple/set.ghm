== Finite Set ==

This is a set #(<{}> x)# formed by taking all the elements of a tuple #x# with length #N#.
Each tuple has a [/wiki/peano/tuple/length | length]
and each number in the sequence can be extracted using the [/wiki/peano/tuple/index | index]
operation. It is defined [/edit/peano/peano_thms.gh/df-tupleset | here]. The reason to
introduce this notation is that since we can use any tuple, this allows us to reason
abstractly about arbitrary finite sets.
