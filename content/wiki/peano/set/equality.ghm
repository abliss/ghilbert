== Set Equality ==

Two sets are equal if they contain exactly the same element. Set equality is defined as

#(<-> (=_ S T) (A. x (<-> (e. x S) (e. x T)))) /edit/peano_new/set_min.ghi/df-seq#

=== Properties ===

* Reflexive: #(=_ S S) /edit/peano_new/set.gh/seqid#
* Symmetric: #(<-> (=_ S T) (=_ T S)) /edit/peano_new/set.gh/seqcom#
* Transitive: #(-> (/\ (=_ S T) (=_ T U)) (=_ S U)) /edit/peano_new/set.gh/seqtr#
