== Uniqueness Quantifier âˆƒ! ==

A formula that uses a uniqueness quantifier expresses that there exists one and only one number with a particular property.
For example, #(E! x (= (* (2) x) (6)))# means that there exists some number #x# for which #(= (* (2) x) (6))# and no other numbers satisfy this property.
