== The Ghilbert Numbering System ==

Every symbol used in Ghilbert must be defined. We have [wiki/peano/arithmetic/numbers | definitions] 
for all the numbers 1 to 10, but it is impossible to define all the number this way. There are
too many. Ghilbert uses a base 10 numbering system for multi-digit numbers. The number 12 is actually
represented internally as 10 + 2. But the numbers are never displayed this way on the proof stack. So
when you look at the proofs you always see (+ (10) (2)) being displayed as 12.
