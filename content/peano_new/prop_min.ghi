## <title> First Axiom: Simplification </title>
## <summary>
##   One of the three axioms of <a href="/wiki/peano/logic">propositional calculus</a>.
##   This axiom is called "the principle of simplification" in Principia Mathematica
##   because "it enables us to pass from the joint assertion of φ and ψ to the assertion
##   of φ	simply."
##
##   <a href="/wiki/peano/logic">Propositional calculus</a> can be thought of as asserting formulas
##   that are universally "true" when their variables are replaced by any combination of
##   "true" and "false."  Propositional calculus was first formalized by
##    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege">Frege</a> in 1879 and simplified by
##    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_%C5%81ukasiewicz">Lukasiewicz</a> around 1930.

#  Axiom //Simp//.  Axiom A1 of [bib/Margaris] p. 49.  One of the 3 axioms of
#      propositional calculus.  The 3 axioms are also given as Definition 2.1
#      of [bib/Hamilton] p. 28.  This axiom is called //Simp// or "the principle of
#      simplification" in //Principia Mathematica// (Theorem *2.02 of
#      [bib/WhiteheadRussell] p. 100) because "it enables us to pass from the joint
#      assertion of #ph# and #ps# to the assertion of #ph# simply."
#
#      //General remarks//:  Propositional calculus (axioms [[ax-1]] through [[ax-3]]
#      and rule [[ax-mp]]) can be thought of as asserting formulas that are
#      universally "true" when their variables are replaced by any combination
#      of "true" and "false."  Propositional calculus was first formalized by
#      Frege in 1879, using as his axioms (in addition to rule [[ax-mp]]) the
#      wffs [[ax-1]], [[ax-2]], [[pm2.04]], [[con3]], [[notnot2]], and [[notnot1]].
#      Around 1930, Lukasiewicz simplified the system by eliminating the third
#      (which follows from the first two, as you can see by looking at the proof
#      of [[pm2.04]]) and replacing the last three with our [[ax-3]].  (Thanks to
#      Ted Ulrich for this information.)
#
#      The theorems of propositional calculus are also called //tautologies//.
#      Tautologies can be proved very simply using truth tables, based on the
#      true/false interpretation of propositional calculus.  To do this, we
#      assign all possible combinations of true and false to the wff variables
#      and verify that the result (using the rules described in [[wi]] and [[wn]])
#      always evaluates to true.  This is called the //semantic// approach.  Our
#      approach is called the //syntactic// approach, in which everything is
#      derived from axioms.  A metatheorem called the Completeness Theorem for
#      Propositional Calculus shows that the two approaches are equivalent and
#      even provides an algorithm for automatically generating syntactic proofs
#      from a truth table.  Those proofs, however, tend to be long, and the
#      much shorter proofs that we show here were found manually.  Truth tables
#      grow exponentially with the number of variables, but it is unknown if the
#      same is true of proofs - an answer to this would resolve the P=NP
#      conjecture in complexity theory.

## <title> Second Logic Axiom: Frege </title>
#  Axiom //Frege//.  Axiom A2 of [bib/Margaris] p. 49.  One of the 3 axioms of
#      propositional calculus.  It "distributes" an antecedent over two
#      consequents.  This axiom was part of Frege's original system and is known
#      as //Frege// in the literature.  It is also proved as Theorem *2.77 of
#      [bib/WhiteheadRussell] p. 108.  The other direction of this axiom also
#      turns out to be true, as demonstrated by [[pm5.41]].

#  Axiom //Transp//.  Axiom A3 of [bib/Margaris] p. 49.  One of the 3 axioms of
#      propositional calculus.  It swaps or "transposes" the order of the
#      consequents when negation is removed.  An informal example is that the
#      statement "if there are no clouds in the sky, it is not raining" implies
#      the statement "if it is raining, there are clouds in the sky."  This
#      axiom is called //Transp// or "the principle of transposition" in
#      //Principia Mathematica// (Theorem *2.17 of [bib/WhiteheadRussell] p. 103).
#      We will also use the term "contraposition" for this principle, although
#      the reader is advised that in the field of philosophical logic,
#      "contraposition" has a different technical meaning.

#  Rule of Modus Ponens.  The postulated inference rule of propositional
#        calculus.  See e.g. Rule 1 of [bib/Hamilton] p. 73.  The rule says, "if
#        #ph# is true, and #ph# implies #ps#, then #ps# must also be
#        true."  This rule is sometimes called "detachment," since it detaches
#        the minor premise from the major premise.
#
#        Note:  In some web page displays such as the Statement List, the symbols
#        "&" and "=>" informally indicate the relationship between the hypotheses
#        and the assertion (conclusion), abbreviating the English words "and" and
#        "implies."  They are not part of the formal language.
